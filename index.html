            <H3>ABOUT ME</H3>
            <p>MY NAME IS DAVID, I'M A 19 YEAR OLD STUDENT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF APPLIED SCIENCES, AMSTERDAM. I'M
                CURRENTLY IN MY FIRST YEAR OF COMMUNICATION AND MULTIMEDIA DESIGN AFTER TWO YEARS OF INTERNATIONAL
                BUSINESS STUDIES IN UTRECHT. DURING MY INTERNSHIP IN BALI, I LEARNED THAT I WANTED TO DIVE DEEPER INTO
                THE WORLD OF DESIGN. AFTER ALMOST ONE YEAR IN AMSTERDAM, I LEARNED THAT CREATING WEBSITES WAS MY PATH TO
                HAPPINESS. SOMETHING THAT WAS FIRST VERY CHALLENGING BECAME SOMETHING I GOT MORE AND MORE USED TO.
                STRUGGLE IS GOOD, IT REMINDS YOU OF HOW MUCH YOU STILL HAVE TO LEARN IN THIS WORLD.
