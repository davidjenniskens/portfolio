    <main class="worstje">
        <p>In our very first Design course called <em>Vormgeving</em>, I was tasked to make an onepage website on my
            favorite food.
            In which I was appointed the visual style called Naive Mascots. Naive Mascots are characterized by a simple
            or childlike visual style. These mascots often have a friendly and approachable appearance, typically with
            exaggerated features or simple designs that make them easily recognizable and memorable. Naive 
            Mascots are often used to create a sense of trustworthiness, reliability, and approachability. They appeal to 
            audiences of all ages and can be effective in promoting brand recognition and loyalty. </p>
        <p>During the course, we focused on working with colour, form, and typography. But also the Gestalt Principles and
            the principles of design. How to make one cohesive lay-out impleting the following laws: the law of simplicity, the law
            of fore and background and the law of proximity. </p>
