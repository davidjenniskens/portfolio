                <p>Melody Match, this might have been the favorite of all the projects I have done in the first year of CMD. 
                After much sweat, effort, discussing, and experimenting, we made a boardgame called Melody Match. We, my team and I, 
                wanted to bring people, especially students, closer to each other. We did this by using Music because everybody loves
                Music right?! With 8 genres, we made cards that were used as conversation starters. We have made a supporting, 
                advertising video to spread the world on Melody Match.</p>
                <p>During this course, we primarily used the BRM cutting laser machine and RISO printer. Both machines I had
                never used before but became quickly familiar with. The RISO printer really gave us the opportunity to create an
                artistic/cool vibe to our cards.
