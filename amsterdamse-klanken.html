        <p> In this Content course, the group was tasked to make a podcast, regarding the view of Amsterdam from the
            eyes of three students, including myself! Around the podcast, we had to make merchandise but also a
            Medium Fidelity website. Even though, the podcast is a private podcast, I still have the website in <a
                href="https://www.figma.com/proto/YA2qOL2ksmEae3FG1xg6H4/Amsterdamse-Klanken?node-id=1-2&t=gvV83euAMLZjA5oR-0&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=1%3A2">Figma</a>.
        </p>
        <p> During the course, we learned how important tone of voice, knowledge of your target audience is and how to 
            build up a brand. We practiced with content and storytelling but it was also a reminder of how important it is how you
            or your company represents themselves at other people. After all, a very good learning lesson. </p>
